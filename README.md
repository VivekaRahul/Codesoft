Developed and evaluated a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements using the Iris flower dataset. Applied multiple supervised learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to compare model performance. Employed techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation and implemented hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy. Conducted exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing steps such as normalization and feature selection to enhance model efficiency. Achieved a classification accuracy of over 95%, reflecting strong analytical skills and a solid understanding of machine learning concepts, model evaluation metrics, and hands-on data science practices.
